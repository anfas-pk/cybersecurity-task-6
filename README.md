# Task 6 - Password Strength Evaluation

## 🔐 Objective
To understand password strength through hands-on testing and best practices.

## 🧪 Passwords Tested
1. `hello123` – Simple, weak
2. `Hello@123` – Fairly strong
3. `H3ll0@W0rld2024!` – Very strong
4. `qwerty123` – Weak/common pattern
5. `A&b#9eK^z!Lm*2Qw` – Extremely strong

## 📝 What I Learned
- Strong passwords have a mix of length, randomness, and characters.
- Avoid predictable patterns.
- Passphrases can also be secure and memorable.
- Password managers are helpful to store complex passwords.

## 🔒 Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force**: Tries every combo.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses common passwords or words.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Reuses leaked passwords on different sites.
